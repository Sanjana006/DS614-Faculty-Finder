Bharani Kollipara,"PhD (English), The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad","I write and teach in the areas of modern philosophy, political theory and South Asian Studies. I am interested in the phenomenological tradition and its wider ramifications in the 20th century as Hermeneutics et al, particularly with reference to phenomenology’s approach to questions in metaphysics. My general research focus is organized around questions pertaining, broadly speaking, to the ontology of tradition in view of its complicated relation to the notion history. Currently I am interested in unraveling the relations between Phenomenology and Hermeneutics. As a trained scholar in literature (Modernism), I bring to bear my literary training on closely reading canonical philosophical texts of the Western tradition. Students interested in working at the intersection between literature and philosophy are encouraged to contact me.","Modern Philosophy, Phenomenology and Hermeneutics, Literary Modernism",
